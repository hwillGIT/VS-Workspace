# Smart Iterative Coding: A Living Team Philosophy

> **"Build the castle brick by brick, with each brick tested before the next layer."**

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Smart Iterative Coding transforms software development from a series of big bangs into a continuous stream of micro-evolutions. Each change is intentional, testable, and reversible—creating psychological safety while accelerating delivery.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

### The Three Pillars

1. **Smart**: Not just fast, but thoughtful. Each iteration has purpose.
2. **Iterative**: True agility through micro-steps, not giant leaps.
3. **Coding**: The craft remains central—we're building lasting systems.

### Cultural Shifts Required

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "Does it run?" | "How will I know it's right?" |
| "I'll commit when done" | "Every passing test deserves a commit" |
| "Rollback = Failure" | "Rollback = Victory for process safety" |
| "Code then document" | "Documentation IS code" |

## 🔄 The Smart Iterative Loop

```
Think (5 min) → Test (Red) → Code (Green) → Refactor → Commit → Learn → Repeat
     ↑                                                                    ↓
     ←────────────── Rollback if needed (celebrate the save!) ──────────←
```

## 📋 Developer Daily Habits

### Every Developer Should:

1. **Write the test first** (or at minimum, before merging)
   ```bash
   # Before coding the feature
   npm test -- --watch user.validation.spec.ts
   ```

2. **Commit as soon as a logical step works**
   ```bash
   # After each micro-victory
   git add -p  # Review changes
   git commit -m "test: add email validation case"
   ```

3. **Push to shared branches daily**
   - No "dark work" hidden on local machines
   - Every push triggers automated checks

4. **Use pre-commit hooks** (non-negotiable)
   ```yaml
   # .pre-commit-config.yaml
   - id: lint
   - id: type-check
   - id: test-affected
   ```

5. **Document the "why" in commits**
   ```
   fix: prevent XSS in user input
   
   Previous regex allowed script tags through HTML entities.
   Added DOMPurify sanitization before validation.
   
   Rollback point: If sanitization breaks legitimate use cases
   ```

## 🧩 Team Rituals & Practices

### Daily Standups 2.0
Include: "What did I commit, and what did I learn?"

Example:
> "Yesterday I committed 5 micro-changes to the auth flow. Learned that our email regex was blocking valid '+' addresses. Already fixed and tested."

### Weekly Retrospectives
Focus on celebrating great saves:
- "Best rollback of the week" award
- "Smallest useful commit" recognition
- "Most helpful test" highlight

### Code Review as Knowledge Transfer
Reviews should ask:
- Why this approach over alternatives?
- What edge cases worried you?
- How would we know if this breaks?

## 💾 Memory & Knowledge Systems

### 1. Codebase Memory Graph

```mermaid
graph TD
    Commit[Commit SHA] --> Test[Test Results]
    Commit --> Decision[Design Decision]
    Decision --> Rationale[Why Document]
    Test --> Learning[Edge Case Found]
    Learning --> Pattern[Reusable Pattern]
    Pattern --> NextFeature[Informs Next Feature]
```

### 2. Living Documentation Structure

```
/docs
  /decisions
    - ADR-001-why-redis-for-sessions.md
    - ADR-002-rollback-payment-service.md
  /gotchas
    - email-validation-edge-cases.md
    - timezone-handling-lessons.md
  /patterns
    - async-error-handling.md
    - test-data-builders.md
  /rollbacks
    - 2024-01-15-auth-service-recovery.md
```

### 3. Embedded Knowledge Tools

```python
# Example: Auto-capture learning moments
@capture_learning
def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    """
    Validates email addresses.
    
    Learnings:
    - 2024-01-10: Added '+' support after user report
    - 2024-01-12: Unicode domains need punycode conversion
    """
    # Actual validation logic
```

- **2024-01-21**: Test caught security issue before code review
- **2024-01-22**: Rollback prevented Black Friday outage
```

## 🤖 AI & Automation Allies

### Commit Assistant
```bash
# AI suggests commit message based on diff
git smart-commit

# Output: "refactor: extract email validation to pure function
#          
#          Moved validation logic from controller to utils.
#          Added comprehensive test cases for edge cases.
#          No behavioral changes."
```

### Pattern Recognition Bot
```python
# Watches for similar changes across codebase
@bot.on_commit
def suggest_patterns(commit):
    similar = find_similar_changes(commit.diff)
    if similar:
        notify(f"Similar to {similar.file}:{similar.line} - consider reusing pattern")
```

### Knowledge Graph Builder
```yaml
# Auto-builds relationships between code elements
on_merge:
  - extract_decisions_from_pr
  - link_tests_to_features
  - update_dependency_graph
  - notify_affected_teams
```

## 🌟 The Ultimate Goal

Transform your team into a learning organism where:
