## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started
**Q: How long does it take to see benefits from Smart Iterative Architecture?**
A: Individual benefits start immediately with architectural context awareness. Team benefits emerge in 2-4 weeks. Organizational benefits compound over 3-6 months.

**Q: Can we implement this gradually?**
A: Yes, the framework is designed for incremental adoption. Start with individual practices, expand to team rituals, then scale organizationally.

**Q: What if our team is resistant to change?**
A: Begin with voluntary pilot groups, demonstrate value through small wins, and gradually expand adoption based on success stories.

### Implementation
**Q: How do we handle legacy systems?**
A: Apply Smart Iterative Architecture to new development first, then gradually improve legacy systems through architectural refactoring guided by the framework.

**Q: What about tight deadlines and pressure?**
A: Smart Iterative Architecture actually helps under pressure by preventing architectural decisions that slow future development. Focus on essential architectural context and options.

**Q: How do we measure ROI?**
A: Track development velocity, system reliability, maintenance costs, and stakeholder satisfaction. The framework includes comprehensive measurement approaches.

### Advanced Usage
**Q: How do we customize the framework for our context?**
A: Follow the framework's own principles: generate options for customization, assess trade-offs, test adaptations, and measure results.

**Q: Can this work with agile/DevOps/other methodologies?**
A: Yes, Smart Iterative Architecture enhances rather than replaces existing methodologies by adding architectural intelligence to iterative development.

**Q: How do we handle distributed teams?**
A: Focus on asynchronous architectural communication, shared documentation standards, and regular architectural alignment sessions across time zones.
