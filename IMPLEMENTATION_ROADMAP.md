# Smart Iterative Architecture: 90-Day Implementation Roadmap

> **"From framework to practice in 90 days—every step measured, every iteration improved."**

## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

This roadmap follows **Smart Iterative principles**—small, measurable steps with continuous feedback loops. Each phase builds on the previous while maintaining architectural integrity throughout the transformation.

## 📅 90-Day Overview

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)     → Establish Architecture-First Thinking
Phase 2: Integration (Days 31-60)   → Embed Smart Iterative Practices  
Phase 3: Optimization (Days 61-90)  → Achieve Self-Improving System
```
