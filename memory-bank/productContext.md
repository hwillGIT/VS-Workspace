# Product Context: Webtester TDD Effectiveness Tool

## 1. Purpose

- **Overall Purpose:** To create a self-contained web application designed to explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies.
- **Value Proposition:** Provide a practical tool for users to understand and visualize the TDD cycle, including code generation from tests, test generation from code, and iterative comparison.

## 2. Problems Solved

- **Problem:** Lack of interactive tools to visualize and experiment with the bidirectional relationship between tests and code in TDD.
- **Solution:** This application allows users to actively engage with the TDD process by:
    - Generating code based on provided test specifications.
    - Generating tests based on provided code.
    - Comparing different versions of code and tests side-by-side.
    - Observing TDD-related metrics.

## 3. How it Should Work

- **Core Functionality:**
    - **Test-to-Code:** Accepts test specifications and generates corresponding code.
    - **Code-to-Test:** Accepts code and generates corresponding tests.
    - **Iteration Management:** Stores and manages multiple generations of code and tests.
    - **Diffing:** Compares selected versions of code against code, or tests against tests.
    - **Metrics Display:** Calculates and displays relevant TDD metrics.
- **User Interaction:**
    - Users input initial test specifications or code.
    - The application generates the corresponding code or tests.
    - Generated artifacts are displayed in tabbed panels within side-by-side canvases (e.g., Left: Code, Right: Tests/Generated Code).
    - Users can select tabs in each canvas and initiate a diff operation.
    - TDD metrics are displayed in expandable sections below the main canvases.

## 4. User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** Provide a clear visualization of the TDD process and the relationship between code and tests.
- **Interactivity:** Allow users to actively experiment with code/test generation and comparison.
- **Insightful:** Offer meaningful metrics to help users understand TDD effectiveness in the context of their inputs.
- **Intuitive:** Design a straightforward interface for inputting specifications/code, managing iterations, and viewing results/diffs.
