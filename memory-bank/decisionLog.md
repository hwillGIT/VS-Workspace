[2025-04-08 19:25:16] - Decision: Implement Automated Task Expansion Feature
Rationale: To enhance workflow efficiency by automatically breaking down complex tasks, inspired by the `task-master expand` functionality. This will reduce manual planning effort for the Orchestrator mode.
Implementation Details:
- Create a new dedicated tool named `expand_task`.
- Tool Parameters: `task_description` (required), `num_subtasks` (optional), `focus_prompt` (optional), `use_research` (optional).
- Tool Output: JSON array of subtask description strings.
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` structure to support hierarchical task tracking (e.g., T1, T1.1, T1.2).
- Orchestrator mode will utilize this tool before delegating complex tasks via `new_task`.


[2025-04-08 21:56:19] - Decision: Define Architecture for Webtester Redesign
Rationale: To establish a clear technical direction for the redesigned TDD effectiveness tool based on clarified requirements.
Implementation Details:
- Architecture: Client-Server (React Frontend, Python/Flask Backend).
- Frontend: React for UI components (side-by-side canvases, tabs, metrics), state management, API client.
- Backend: Python/Flask for REST API, request handling, service orchestration.
- Services (Backend):
    - Code/Test Generation Service (integrating existing LLM components).
    - Diffing Service (using Python `difflib`).
    - Metrics Calculation Service.
    - Iteration Storage Manager (using File System initially).
- Interfaces: REST API between Frontend/Backend, direct Python calls for Backend/LLM, File System operations for storage.
- Documentation: High-level design captured in `webtester/redesign_architecture.md`.

[2025-05-13 18:51:38] - Decision: Establish Project Management Tools
## Decision
* Task management will be handled using Task Master.
* Version control will be handled using Git.
## Rationale
* Task Master is already integrated into the project structure (`tasks/`, `README-task-master.md`) and its automated task expansion feature is documented, indicating existing familiarity and workflow.
* Git is a widely adopted standard for version control, and the presence of `.gitkeep` files suggests it is already in use.
## Implementation Details
* Task Master will be used to create, track, and manage project tasks and subtasks, likely utilizing the `tasks/tasks.json` file and individual task files.
* Git will be used for all code versioning, including branching, committing, merging, and collaboration workflows.

[2025-05-13 18:53:06] - Repository Management Plan Defined

## Decision

Adopt a monorepo structure for the project, including `backend`, `frontend`, and `llm_integration_api` subdirectories. Implement a Trunk-Based Development branching strategy with a single `main` branch and short-lived feature branches. Manage build artifacts within project subdirectories and use Git tags for versioning.

## Rationale

A monorepo simplifies dependency management and allows for atomic commits across related services. Trunk-Based Development promotes continuous integration and delivery with a clean, always-releasable main branch. Managing artifacts within the repo initially is sufficient for the current project scope, with the option to introduce an artifact repository later if needed.

## Implementation Details

- Project structure will include top-level directories for `backend`, `frontend`, `llm_integration_api`, `docs`, `scripts`, and `build`.
- Development will occur on short-lived feature branches merged into `main` via Pull Requests.
- Releases will be tagged directly from the `main` branch using Semantic Versioning.
- Build outputs will be directed to `/build` or `/dist` within project subdirectories and excluded from Git.
- Dependencies will be managed per subdirectory using appropriate package managers.

[2025-05-13 20:31:43] - Decision: Incorporate Dockerization and Configurable Schema
## Decision
* The application will be containerized using Docker to ensure reproducibility for unfamiliar users.
* The database schema will be definable via configuration files, allowing for easy extension and recreation of the schema with additional tables and rows.
## Rationale
* Docker provides a consistent environment, simplifying setup and deployment across different machines.
* A configurable schema allows users to easily modify and extend the data model without requiring code changes, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
## Implementation Details
* Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend services.
* Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the frontend, backend, and database containers.
* Define a format for schema configuration files (e.g., YAML or JSON).
* Implement logic in the backend to read the schema configuration and apply it to the database on startup or via a dedicated command.
* Update documentation to include instructions for building and running the application with Docker and configuring the schema.
