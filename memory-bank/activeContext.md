# Active Context: Webtester Redesign

## 1. Current Work Focus

- **Primary Goal:** Begin the implementation phase of the `webtester` application redesign based on the approved architecture.
- **Immediate Tasks:**
    - Set up the initial project structure for the React frontend.
    - Set up the initial project structure for the Python/Flask backend.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **[2025-04-08 21:52:20]** Requirements clarified: The application is a TDD effectiveness tool involving code/test generation, diffing, and metrics display.
- **[2025-04-08 21:53:29]** `productContext.md` updated with detailed requirements.
- **[2025-04-08 21:55:39]** High-level architecture (React frontend, Python/Flask backend, file system storage) defined and approved.
- **[2025-04-08 21:56:07]** Architecture documented in `webtester/redesign_architecture.md`.
- **[2025-04-08 21:56:39]** Architectural decisions logged in `decisionLog.md`.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Priority 1:** Create the basic directory structure and initial configuration files for the React frontend.
- **Priority 2:** Create the basic directory structure and initial configuration files for the Flask backend.
- **Priority 3:** Define the core API endpoints in the Flask backend.
- **Priority 4:** Implement basic UI components in the React frontend.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Storage:** Currently using the file system for simplicity. May need to revisit database integration (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) if complexity increases or specific querying needs arise.
- **API Specification:** Detailed request/response formats for the REST API need to be defined during backend implementation.
- **LLM Integration:** Specific integration points and error handling for the LLM generation services need refinement during backend implementation.
