# 3. Task Management with Task Master

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Effective project management is crucial for organizing work, tracking progress, and coordinating efforts across the development team. A standardized approach to task management is needed to ensure clarity and efficiency throughout the project lifecycle.

## Decision

We will utilize Task Master as the primary tool for project task management. This includes creating, tracking, and managing tasks and subtasks using the Task Master file format (likely `tasks/tasks.json` and individual task files). The automated task expansion feature provided by Task Master will be leveraged to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.

## Consequences

- **Standardized Workflow:** Provides a consistent method for defining and tracking project tasks.
- **Improved Organization:** Hierarchical task structure (with subtasks) allows for better organization and breakdown of complex work.
- **Automated Task Expansion:** Reduces manual effort in planning and detailing tasks.
- **Integration with Existing Tools:** Task Master is already present in the project structure, indicating existing familiarity.
- **Dependency on Task Master Tool:** The project's task management is dependent on the availability and functionality of the Task Master tool.
- **Learning Curve:** Team members may need to become familiar with the Task Master workflow and file format.
- **Potential for Tooling Issues:** Any issues with the Task Master tool could impact project management.
