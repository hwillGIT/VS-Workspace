# 2. Webtester Client-Server Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Webtester tool requires a robust and scalable architecture to support its functionality, including code/test generation, diffing, metrics calculation, and iteration management. A clear separation of concerns between the user interface and the backend processing is necessary for maintainability and future expansion.

## Decision

The Webtester tool will be implemented using a client-server architecture. The frontend will be developed using React, providing the user interface with side-by-side canvases, tabs, and metrics display. The backend will be built with Python/Flask, exposing a REST API to handle requests for code/test generation, diffing, metrics calculation, and iteration storage.

## Consequences

- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The frontend and backend are distinct, allowing for independent development and scaling.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Changes to the UI or backend logic can be made without affecting the other layer significantly.
- **Scalability:** The backend can be scaled independently to handle increased processing load.
- **Technology Specialization:** Allows for the use of technologies best suited for frontend (React) and backend (Python/Flask) development.
- **Increased Complexity:** Managing communication and data flow between the client and server adds complexity compared to a monolithic application.
- **API Design Overhead:** Designing and maintaining a well-defined REST API is crucial.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Management:** CORS policies need to be configured to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
