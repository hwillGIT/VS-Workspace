# 1. Monorepo Structure and Trunk-Based Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a clear and efficient strategy for managing code repositories and development workflow. As the project grows and incorporates multiple components (backend, frontend, LLM integration), a unified approach is necessary to maintain consistency, simplify dependency management, and facilitate collaboration.

## Decision

We will adopt a monorepo structure for the project, housing all related codebases (backend, frontend, LLM integration API, documentation, scripts, etc.) within a single repository. We will implement a Trunk-Based Development branching strategy, utilizing a single `main` branch for the primary development line and short-lived feature branches for new work.

## Consequences

- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Dependencies shared across components can be managed more easily within a single repository.
- **Atomic Commits:** Changes affecting multiple components can be committed together, ensuring consistency.
- **Streamlined CI/CD:** A monorepo can simplify the setup and management of continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.
- **Increased Collaboration:** Developers can easily access and contribute to different parts of the project.
- **Potential for Increased Repository Size:** The repository size may grow significantly over time.
- **Need for careful tooling:** Tools for managing dependencies, builds, and testing within a monorepo are necessary.
- **Faster Integration:** Short-lived feature branches and direct merging into `main` promote continuous integration.
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts:** Frequent integration minimizes the likelihood and complexity of merge conflicts.
- **Requires strong testing culture:** To maintain a stable `main` branch, comprehensive automated testing is crucial.
- **Potential for build bottlenecks:** Without proper tooling, building the entire monorepo can become time-consuming.
