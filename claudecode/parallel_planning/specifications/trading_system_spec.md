- **Real-time** (< 100ms) for risk monitoring
- **Near real-time** (< 1s) for reporting and analytics

### Risk Management Integration

Every perspective must address:
- **Pre-trade risk checks** - Position limits, concentration limits
- **Real-time monitoring** - Continuous risk assessment
- **Post-trade analysis** - Performance and risk attribution
