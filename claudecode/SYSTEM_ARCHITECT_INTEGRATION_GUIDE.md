### **Analysis Pipeline**

1. **Project Scanning** - Discovers and catalogs all code components
2. **Architecture Analysis** - Maps system structure and relationships
3. **Dependency Analysis** - Detects circular dependencies and coupling issues
4. **Code Metrics** - Measures complexity, maintainability, and quality
5. **Security Audit** - Scans for vulnerabilities and security risks
6. **Performance Analysis** - Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
7. **Migration Planning** - Plans for version upgrades and framework changes
8. **Health Assessment** - Generates overall system health score
9. **Report Generation** - Creates detailed reports and actionable recommendations

## ⏰ **When System Architect Runs**

### **1. Continuous Integration (CI/CD) Integration**

#### **Pre-commit Hook** (30-60 seconds)
```bash
# Automatically runs on every commit
git commit -m "your changes"
# Triggers: Quick scope analysis
# Focus: Security vulnerabilities, basic complexity checks
# Output: Pass/fail for quality gates
```

**What it analyzes:**
- Changed files only
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Basic complexity thresholds
- Code smell detection
- Critical quality gates

**Example Output:**
```
System Architect - Pre-commit Analysis
=====================================
Files Analyzed: 3
Security Issues: 1 (CRITICAL - hardcoded API key)
Complexity Issues: 0
Quality Gate: FAILED
Action Required: Fix security issue before commit
```

#### **Pull Request Analysis** (2-5 minutes)
```bash
# Runs automatically on PR creation/update
git push origin feature/new-agent
# Triggers: Standard scope analysis
# Focus: Comprehensive feature impact assessment
# Output: Detailed PR analysis report
```

**What it analyzes:**
- All files in the feature branch
- Cross-component impact analysis
- Dependency changes and circular dependencies
- Test coverage impact
- Performance implications
- Security audit of new code

**Example Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/system-architect.yml
name: System Architect Analysis
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  architecture-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: System Architect Analysis
        run: |
          python -m system_architect.analyze --scope standard --export json,html
          python -m system_architect.report --pr-comment
```

#### **Nightly Build Analysis** (10-30 minutes)
```bash
# Runs every night via cron job
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python -m system_architect.analyze --scope comprehensive
# Triggers: Comprehensive scope analysis
# Focus: Full system health assessment
# Output: Complete architecture health report
```

**What it analyzes:**
- Entire codebase comprehensive analysis
- Historical trend analysis
- Architecture evolution tracking
- Performance benchmarking
- Security compliance checking

#### **Release Preparation Analysis** (30-60 minutes)
```bash
# Manual trigger before major releases
python -m system_architect.analyze --scope deep --migration-planning
# Triggers: Deep scope analysis
# Focus: Release readiness assessment
# Output: Go/no-go recommendation with detailed analysis
```

### **2. Development Workflow Integration**

#### **IDE Integration**
```python
# VS Code Extension: System Architect
# Real-time analysis as you type
# Immediate feedback on:
# - Complexity increases
# - Security issues
# - Architecture violations
# - Code quality degradation
```

#### **Local Development**
```bash
# Manual execution during development
cd trading_system
python run_system_architect_simple.py

# Quick health check
python -m system_architect.quick-check

# Focus analysis on specific component
python -m system_architect.analyze --component agents/ml_ensemble
```

### **3. Automated Triggers**

#### **Threshold-Based Triggers**
- **Complexity Threshold Exceeded**: Automatic analysis when cyclomatic complexity > 15
- **Security Alert**: Immediate scan when security patterns detected
- **Dependency Changes**: Analysis when new dependencies added
- **Coverage Drop**: Review when test coverage decreases > 5%

#### **Event-Driven Triggers**
- **New Agent Added**: Full integration analysis
- **Framework Upgrade**: Migration impact assessment
- **Production Incident**: Emergency health check
- **Performance Regression**: Bottleneck identification
