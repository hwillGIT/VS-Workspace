Generate comprehensive test cases covering:

## Test Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual function/method behavior
   - Cover edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure proper mocking of dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify data flow between modules
   - Check external service integrations

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Verify system behavior from user perspective
   - Check critical business processes

## Context-Driven Testing
Based on project history and patterns:
- Apply testing patterns used successfully in this project
- Reference previous bug reports for test case ideas
- Consider project-specific quality requirements

## Test Implementation
Generate specific test code with:
- Clear test descriptions and purpose
- Proper setup and teardown procedures
- Assertions that validate expected behavior
- Error case handling
