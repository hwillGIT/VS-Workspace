Systematic debugging and troubleshooting:

## Problem Analysis

1. **Issue Identification**
   - Clearly define the problem or unexpected behavior
   - Identify affected components or systems
   - Determine scope and impact

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Trace the issue to its source
   - Identify contributing factors
   - Review recent changes that might be related

3. **Solution Development**
   - Propose multiple solution approaches
   - Evaluate pros and cons of each approach
   - Select optimal solution strategy

## Context-Informed Debugging
Leverage project knowledge:
- Reference similar issues resolved in the past
- Apply debugging patterns successful in this project
- Consider project-specific constraints and requirements

## Resolution Plan
Provide detailed resolution with:
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Testing strategy to verify the fix
- Prevention measures for future occurrences
