Review system architecture and design:

## Architecture Analysis

1. **System Design**
   - Evaluate overall system architecture
   - Review component relationships and dependencies
   - Assess design pattern implementation

2. **Scalability & Performance**
   - Analyze system scalability characteristics
   - Review performance bottlenecks
   - Assess resource utilization patterns

3. **Maintainability & Extensibility**
   - Evaluate code organization and modularity
   - Review interface design and contracts
   - Assess system flexibility for future changes

## Historical Architecture Context
Consider previous architectural decisions:
- Reference established architectural patterns in this project
- Apply lessons learned from previous design decisions
- Consider project-specific constraints and requirements

## Recommendations
Provide architectural improvements with:
- Impact on system quality attributes
- Implementation strategy and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation approaches
