2. Increase test coverage from 13% to target 80%+
3. Refactor high-complexity functions
4. Add automated quality gates to CI/CD

## 🎯 **Usage Instructions**

### **Quick Start:**
```python
from trading_system.agents.system_architect.master_coordinator import analyze_project

# Analyze your project
results = await analyze_project("/path/to/your/project")
print(f"Health Score: {results['health_report']['overall_score']}/100")
```

### **Individual Agent Usage:**
```python
from trading_system.agents.system_architect import (
    CodeMetricsDashboard,
    DependencyAnalysisAgent,
    SecurityAuditAgent
)

# Use specific agents
metrics_agent = CodeMetricsDashboard(config)
results = await metrics_agent.generate_dashboard("/path/to/project")
```

### **CI/CD Integration:**
```bash
# Pre-commit hook (30-60 seconds)
python -m system_architect.analyze --scope quick --files changed

# Pull request analysis (2-5 minutes)  
python -m system_architect.analyze --scope standard --branch feature/new-feature

# Nightly build (10-30 minutes)
python -m system_architect.analyze --scope comprehensive --export html,json
```

## 🧪 **Verification Commands**
