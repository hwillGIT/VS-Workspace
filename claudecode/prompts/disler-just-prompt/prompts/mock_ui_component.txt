Build vue, react, and svelte components for this component definition:

<TableOfContents :tree="tree" />

The tree is a json object that looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "TableOfContents",
    "children": [
        {
            "name": "Item",
            "children": [
                {
                    "name": "Item",
                    "children": []
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Item 2",
            "children": []
        }
    ]
}
```
