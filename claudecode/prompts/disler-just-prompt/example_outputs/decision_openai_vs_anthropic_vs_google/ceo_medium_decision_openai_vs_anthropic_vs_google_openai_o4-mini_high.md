Here’s a focused comparison of OpenAI, Anthropic and Google along your three axes—Model Performance, Model Tool Use and Model Cost—plus a bottom‑line “which to pick” based on different priorities.

1. Model Performance (Raw Intelligence)  
    • OpenAI (o3 / GPT‑4o): leads most public benchmarks, best vision‑reasoning, continuous frontier releases.  
   • Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro): at parity on reasoning & code benchmarks, unrivaled context windows (1M→2M tokens soon).  
   • Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): very strong in free‑form reasoning, matches or beats GPT‑4‑Turbo in text tasks but lags on vision/speech.  

2. Model Tool Use (Ability to orchestrate APIs, plug‑ins, agents)  
    • OpenAI: richest ecosystem—Assistants API with built‑in tool discovery, function‑calls, vision+generation APIs out of the box.  
   • Anthropic: clean, safety‑centric JSON tool schema; coming tooling ecosystem but fewer first‑party connectors (no vision yet).  
   • Google: Vertex AI + AI Studio pipelines, good SDKs and open‑weight Gemma for on‑prem, but less mature “agent” layer than OpenAI.  

3. Model Cost (Price / Performance at scale)  
    • Anthropic (Sonnet tier): cheapest per token for GPT‑4‑level quality today.  
   • Google (Vertex discounts & Gemma open models): aggressive pricing and on‑device options with Gemma 3.  
   • OpenAI: steadily falling prices, but top‑end O‑series still carries a premium vs Sonnet/Gemini mid‑tiers.  

Summary “Bet” Recommendations  
  • If you care most about **bleeding‑edge capabilities + seamless, production‑ready tool/agent support**, lean into **OpenAI**. You get top scores, the largest third‑party connector ecosystem and Microsoft’s enterprise muscle—at a premium price.  
  • If **unit economics** (cost‑performance) is your #1 driver and you value a safety‑first alignment ethos, **Anthropic** is the sweet spot. You give up some multimodal/speech features but gain the lowest cost for GPT‑4‑class chat and clean tool integration.  
  • If you prize **distribution scale, open‑weight fallbacks and full control over compute**, **Google** stands out. You’ll trade a slightly slower release cadence and less “agent magic” for unrivaled throughput (TPUs + 1M+ token contexts), built‑in Workspace/Android reach and on‑prem options.  

All three are competitive on raw intelligence. Your choice really comes down to your biggest lever:  
  – Performance & tooling ⇒ OpenAI  
  – Cost‑performance & alignment ⇒ Anthropic  
  – Distribution & compute sovereignty ⇒ Google  

Whichever you pick, pilot a real workload (with rate limits, enterprise features, support SLAs) before you commit multi‑year spend. This space is evolving so rapidly that today’s “win” can shift next quarter.
