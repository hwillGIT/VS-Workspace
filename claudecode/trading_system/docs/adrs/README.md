# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the ClaudeCode Trading System. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Tags |
|-----|-------|---------|------|------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-functional-programming-integration.md) | Functional Programming Integration for Enhanced Reliability | Accepted | 2025-07-30 | functional-programming, reliability, mathematics |

## ADR Template

For creating new ADRs, use the following structure:

### Required Sections
1. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
2. **Context and Problem Statement** - What problem are we solving?
3. **Decision Drivers and Constraints** - What factors influenced this decision?
4. **Considered Options** - What alternatives did we evaluate?
5. **Decision Outcome and Rationale** - What did we decide and why?
6. **Positive and Negative Consequences** - What are the trade-offs?
7. **Implementation Details** - How is this decision implemented?
8. **Follow-up Actions** - What needs to happen next?

### Optional Sections
- **Monitoring and Success Criteria** - How will we measure success?
- **Related ADRs** - Links to related decisions
- **References** - External resources

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial draft created and under review
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and ready for implementation
3. **Implemented** - Decision has been fully implemented
4. **Deprecated** - Decision is no longer relevant
5. **Superseded** - Decision replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- Architectural decisions with long-term impact
- Technology choice decisions
- Significant design pattern adoptions
- Major refactoring decisions
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Integration strategies
- Performance or security trade-offs

### ADR Naming Convention
`ADR-XXX-descriptive-title.md`
- XXX: Sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
- Use kebab-case for title
- Keep titles concise but descriptive

### Review Process
1. Create ADR in "Proposed" status
2. Share with relevant stakeholders
3. Incorporate feedback
4. Move to "Accepted" status after approval
5. Update status to "Implemented" after completion

## Tools and Resources

### ADR Management
The trading system includes an [ADR Manager](../../agents/system_architect/adr_manager.py) agent that can:
- Generate ADR templates
- Track ADR status
- Analyze decision dependencies
- Generate reports
