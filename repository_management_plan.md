# Repository Management Plan

## 1. Repository Structure:

Given the existing directories (`backend`, `frontend`, `llm_integration_api`), a monorepo structure is recommended. This approach keeps related projects together, simplifies dependency management between internal packages, and facilitates atomic commits across different parts of the system.

Proposed structure:

```
/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── repository_management_plan.md  (This document)
├── backend/                     (Backend service code)
├── frontend/                    (Frontend application code)
├── llm_integration_api/         (LLM integration service code)
├── docs/                        (Documentation files)
├── scripts/                     (Build, deploy, and utility scripts)
├── build/                       (Directory for build artifacts)
└── ... (other project files)
```

Each subdirectory (`backend`, `frontend`, `llm_integration_api`) should contain its own specific code, dependencies, and build configurations.

## 2. Branching Strategy:

Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is recommended for its simplicity and compatibility with Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices.

*   **Main Branch (`main` or `trunk`):** This branch is the single source of truth and should always be in a releasable state. All development work is merged into this branch frequently.
*   **Feature Branches:** Short-lived branches created from `main` for developing new features or fixing bugs. They should be merged back into `main` as soon as the work is complete and reviewed (via Pull Requests).
*   **No long-lived development or release branches:** Releases are cut directly from the `main` branch using tags.

Alternative: Gitflow could be used if a more structured release process with dedicated release branches is required, but TBD is generally simpler and faster for continuous delivery.

## 3. Artifact Management:

*   **Build Output:** Compiled code, bundled assets, and other build outputs should be generated into a dedicated directory, such as `/build` or `/dist`, within the respective project subdirectories (e.g., `/frontend/build`). These directories should typically be excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
*   **Versioning:** Use Git tags to mark release points on the `main` branch (e.g., `v1.0.0`). Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is recommended for clear version progression.
*   **Dependencies:** Each project subdirectory should manage its own dependencies using appropriate package managers (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js, `requirements.txt` for Python).
*   **Artifact Repository:** For larger projects or microservices, consider using an artifact repository (like Nexus, Artifactory, or a cloud-specific service) to store build artifacts for deployment and sharing. For this project's current scope, managing artifacts within the repository and using tags for releases is sufficient.

This plan provides a clear structure for development, collaboration, and release management.
