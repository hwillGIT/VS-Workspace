# Architecture-First Development Framework

> **"Design first, then iterate smart. Every line of code should know its place in the bigger picture."**

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Architecture-First Development treats architecture as the **nervous system of your software**—not abstract blueprints, but the living foundation that coordinates system behavior. It integrates with Smart Iterative Coding to ensure **every micro-iteration operates within a well-defined architectural context**, fighting "cruft" from day one and enabling systems that gracefully adapt and grow.

## 🏗️ The Architecture-First Process

### Phase 1: Architectural Discovery (Before Any Code)

#### 1.1 Context Analysis
```markdown
## Project Context Matrix
| Dimension | Constraint | Impact | Options |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Client Type** | Enterprise/Startup/Government | Budget, Compliance, Scale | TOGAF vs Lean Architecture |
| **Team Size** | 2-50+ developers | Complexity tolerance | Monolith vs Microservices |
| **Timeline** | MVP/6mo/2yr+ | Technical debt tolerance | Quick start vs Future-proof |
| **Security Req** | Public/Internal/Classified | Architecture constraints | CISSP principles required |
| **Scale** | 100 users vs 1M+ | Performance requirements | Horizontal vs Vertical |
```

#### 1.2 Architecture Framework Selection
Present **multiple options** with trade-offs:

**Enterprise Architecture Frameworks:**
- **TOGAF ADM**: Large enterprise, formal governance needed
- **Zachman Framework**: Complex compliance, multiple stakeholder views
- **FEAF**: Government projects, federal compliance
- **DODAF**: Defense/military projects, interoperability focus
- **ArchiMate**: Visual modeling, cross-domain analysis
- **Lean EA**: Startup/SME, minimal overhead

**Software Architecture Styles:**
- **Monolithic**: Simple deployment, single team, MVP timeline
- **Microservices**: Large team, independent scaling, fault isolation
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time systems, loose coupling, async processing
- **Layered**: Traditional business apps, clear separation of concerns
- **Hexagonal**: Domain-rich systems, testability, DDD alignment
- **Clean Architecture**: Long-term maintainability, plugin architecture

**Security Architecture (CISSP Principles):**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default configuration

### Phase 2: Diagrams as Code Foundation

#### 2.1 Tool Selection Matrix
```markdown
| Tool | Best For | Pros | Cons | Use When |
|------|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Structurizr** | C4 Model purist | C4 native, interactive | Cost, learning curve | Dedicated C4 adoption |
| **PlantUML** | Technical teams | Flexible, free | Syntax complexity | Multi-diagram types |
| **Mermaid** | GitHub integration | Built-in support | Limited layouts | Documentation-heavy |
| **draw.io** | Mixed audiences | Visual editor | Not pure code | Stakeholder presentations |
| **Lucidchart** | Business teams | Collaboration | Subscription cost | Cross-functional teams |
```

#### 2.2 Multi-Perspective Diagram Strategy

**C4 Model Levels (Mandatory):**
```
Level 1: System Context
├── Actors (users, external systems)
├── System boundary
└── Key interactions

Level 2: Container Diagram  
├── Applications/services
├── Data stores
├── Technology choices
└── Communication protocols

Level 3: Component Diagram
├── Internal structure
├── Interfaces
├── Dependencies
└── Responsibilities

Level 4: Code Diagram (Generated)
├── Classes/modules
├── Design patterns
└── Implementation details
```

**Supplementary Views (As Needed):**
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure, environments
- **Dynamic Diagrams**: Process flows, sequence
- **Landscape Diagrams**: Multi-system ecosystem

## 🔄 Integration with Smart Iterative Coding

### Architectural Micro-Iterations
```
Traditional: Design Everything → Build Everything → Test Everything
Architecture-First: Design Context → Iterate Within Context → Evolve Architecture
```

### Iteration Workflow
```
1. Check Architectural Context (30 sec)
   - What component am I working in?
   - What are the established patterns?
   - What are the constraints?

2. Plan Micro-Change (2 min)
   - Does this fit the architecture?
   - Do I need to update diagrams?
   - Any new patterns emerging?

3. Implement & Test (10-30 min)
   - Code within architectural boundaries
   - Follow established patterns
   - Test integration points

4. Update Architecture Artifacts (2 min)
   - Update diagrams if structure changed
   - Document new patterns discovered
   - Flag architectural debt

5. Commit with Context (1 min)
   git commit -m "feat: add user validation [ARCH]
   
   Component: UserManagement/Validation
   Pattern: Hexagonal/Ports-Adapters
   Diagram: Updated component relationships
   
   Follows established validation pipeline pattern.
   No architectural boundaries crossed."
```
