#### Smart Iterative Decision Template
```markdown
# Architecture Decision: [Brief Title]

## Context (1 minute)
**Problem**: What architectural challenge am I solving?
**Constraints**: Time, team skills, existing patterns, quality requirements

## Options (3 minutes)
### Option 1: [Minimal Change]
- **Approach**: Extend existing pattern
- **Pros**: Low risk, familiar to team, quick implementation
- **Cons**: May not address long-term needs
- **Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

### Option 2: [Strategic Investment]  
- **Approach**: Introduce new architectural capability
- **Pros**: Better long-term solution, addresses root cause
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, learning curve
- **Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

### Option 3: [Hybrid Solution]
- **Approach**: Combine elements thoughtfully
- **Pros**: Balanced approach, gradual improvement
- **Cons**: Potential complexity, need careful integration
- **Effort**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Decision (1 minute)
**Chosen**: Option X
**Rationale**: [Why this choice given current constraints]
**Validation Plan**: [How I'll know if this was right choice]
**Rollback Strategy**: [What I'll do if this doesn't work]

"Think of a time when poor software architecture slowed you down. What happened?"

### Workshop Objectives
By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand Smart Iterative Architecture core principles
- Identify your primary architectural persona
- Practice the basic Smart Iterative cycle
- Leave with templates for immediate use

## Core Concepts (20 minutes)
### The Nervous System Metaphor (5 min)
- Architecture as system coordination mechanism
- Micro-evolutions vs big-bang changes
- Cruft as system dysfunction

### Four Architectural Personas (10 min)
**Exercise**: Read persona descriptions, identify your primary
- Risk Mitigator: "What could go wrong?"
- Complexity Orchestrator: "What are the building blocks?"  
- Multi-Perspective Communicator: "Who needs to understand this?"
- Continuous Steward: "How does this fit our evolution?"

### Options-First Decision Making (5 min)
**Principle**: Always generate 2-3 alternatives
**Exercise**: Quick practice with current team challenge

## Hands-On Practice (20 minutes)
### Smart Iterative Cycle Walkthrough (10 min)
Using a real current feature:
1. Architectural Context Setting (2 min)
2. Options Generation (3 min)
3. Decision with Rationale (2 min)

### This Week Commitments
Each person commits to:
- [ ] Use architectural context for next 3 features
- [ ] Practice options generation for next significant decision
- [ ] Try new commit message template for 1 week

### Questions & Wrap-up
**Key Takeaway**: Architecture awareness in every iteration, not just big decisions
```

### Architecture Decision Workshop Template
```markdown
# Architecture Decision Workshop (90 minutes)

## Preparation (Send 24 hours ahead)
**Scenario**: [Describe realistic architectural challenge team faces]
**Background Materials**: [Current system context, constraints, stakeholders]
**Pre-work**: Each participant should come with one initial approach idea

## Workshop Flow

### Problem Exploration (15 minutes)
- **Constraint Mapping**: What are our real limitations?
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who cares about this decision and why?
- **Quality Attributes**: What non-functional requirements matter most?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know we made a good choice?

### Option Generation (30 minutes)
**Individual Brainstorming (10 min)**:
- Each person generates 2-3 approaches independently
- Use template: Approach / Pros / Cons / Effort / Risk

**Small Group Synthesis (15 min)**:
- Groups of 2-3 combine and refine options
- Focus on making options distinct and viable
- Identify key trade-offs

**Full Group Sharing (5 min)**:
- Each group presents their top 2 options
- Capture all options on shared surface

### Option Evaluation (25 minutes)
**Trade-off Analysis (15 min)**:
- Map each option against quality attributes
- Assess implementation effort and risk
- Consider alignment with current architecture

**Stakeholder Perspective Review (10 min)**:
- How would each stakeholder view each option?
- What would each option enable or prevent?
- Which options support future evolution?

### Decision Making (15 minutes)
**Convergence Process**:
- Eliminate clearly inferior options
- Deep dive on remaining 2-3 options
- Use decision criteria from problem exploration
- Make decision with clear rationale

**Documentation**:
- Complete decision template together
- Assign follow-up actions
- Plan validation approach

### Wrap-up (5 minutes)
**Lessons Learned**:
- What made this decision process effective?
- How can we improve architectural decision making?
- What tools or techniques should we adopt?
```

These templates provide immediate, practical tools for teams to begin implementing Smart Iterative Architecture principles from day one, with minimal setup and maximum impact.
